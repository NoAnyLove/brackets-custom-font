# Brackets Custom Font

A simple extension to customize the UI font size for Brackets. It is related to Brackets [Issue #11161](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/issues/11161), I can't find the link where I first saw this problem. I wrote this simple extension at 2015/1/4, but didn't publish it. I thought it was too simple, and I'm too lazy to improve it, e.g., add an user-friendly setting interface.

However, I just updated to Brackets 1.10, and found this problem still exsists. I decided to upload this extension to GitHub, in case I might need to install it sometime. The CSS style is my own personal preference, if you don't like it, you can modify `style.css` file under the extension folder, or try the extensions listed below,
